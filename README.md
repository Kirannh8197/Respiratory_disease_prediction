# Respiratory Disease Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict respiratory diseases based on patient data. The goal of this project is to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making by leveraging predictive analytics.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw patient data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for disease prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for model performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes a simple web interface or API for easy interaction with the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized patient records, including features such as:
-respiratory breath sounds

**Note**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to use and share the dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
